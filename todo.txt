ChemJS To Do

- see OpenBabel Atom class. Do I need to make a separate Atom class?
- start implementing GraphJS functions so that ChemJS will work properly

- start working on the annoying SMARTS/SMILES/MOL-READ/WRITE crap.



-------------


No more ChemDoodle web services or ChemSpider AJAX. Too frustrating.
Solution:
- ChemJS will support molecular construction of molecules based on MOL file string.
- if SMILES are not available or the user desires some alternative format, they can use MY web services, which will include a very simple AJAX API with CORS enabled. FREE FOR ALL, as long as the service is not abused.

function getMolFile(inputFormat, outputFormat) {
	//returns a Mol file string, which you then pass into the readMOL
}

> this in itself can be an entire web service. 
But how to make this system work for Apps running on Facebook domain or iFrame applications?

- setupMetaData() function will also classify the molecule (aromatic, protein/nucleic acid, etc)
